## Overview

This project is a **Media Management System** that allows users to register, log in, upload photos, and manage visibility and comments.
It builds upon **Assignment 3**, which served as the foundation for our Phase 1 development.

Phase 1 focuses on **user authentication**, **photo visibility**, and **commenting functionality**.

## Features Implemented (Phase 1)

* User registration and login (authentication)
* View all **public** photos and **user-owned** photos
* Add **visibility flag** (public/private) for photos
* Allow logged-in users to **edit their own photos**
* Logged-in users can **comment** on public or owned photos
* Comments are **visible to all users**
* Non-logged-in users are **redirected** to the login page

> Future development (Phase 2) will include album galleries, uploads, email notifications, and search functionality.

## Architecture

This project follows a **layered architecture** consisting of:

* **Presentation Layer:** UI templates and routes for user interaction
* **Business Logic Layer:** Core functionality and logic handling
* **Persistence Layer:** Database operations and persistence
